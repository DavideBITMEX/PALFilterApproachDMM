# Filtering Artificial NBHF Signals from F-POD Data
This repository contains the data and scripts used to develop a semi-automated filtering approach to remove artificial Narrow Band High Frequency (NBHF) signals generated by Porpoise-ALert (PAL) devices from click-trains detected by F-PODs.

## Overview
The filtering method is based on a multi-sensor setup where several F-PODs are deployed at different distances from the PAL device. One F-POD is designated as a reference, and its detections are used to identify and filter out artificial NBHF signals in the recordings from the other devices.

This methodology has proven to be:

- ✅ Highly effective in detecting a large number of artificial NBHF click-trains produced by the PAL device

- ⏱️ Efficient, significantly reducing processing time compared to manual filtering

- 📈 Reliable, enabling accurate long-term monitoring of harbor porpoise acoustic activity even in environments with artificial NBHF sources
